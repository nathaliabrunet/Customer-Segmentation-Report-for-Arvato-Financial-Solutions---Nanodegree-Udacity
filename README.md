## Project Motivation
This project is part of the capstone requirement for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal is to perform a segmentation of customers, and with the knowledge obtained, identify whether a customer will respond to a specific marketing campaign or not. Thus, it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the campaign by directing it to an audience with a greater potential to " be reached" the campaign. In summary, the goal is to improve the performance of marketing campaigns.

## Overview
Arvato is a business services company operating in different parts of the world, offering financial solutions in the most diverse forms, from payment processing to risk management activities, with development always focused on innovation. Arvato is owned by Bertelsmann, which is a media, services and education company operating in more than 50 countries and one of its priorities is to value solutions with an emphasis on creativity and entrepreneurship [www.bertelsmann.com].

In this context, it is interesting to understand the customer segments that the company serves. For a company with a large customer base, the customer segmentation stage is very important. It aims to obtain more information (and really relevant information) from its customers, which can be used for a more personalized and targeted service, for example


## Data
The datasets is not not publically available, were provided by Bertelsmann/Arvato in the context of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. It is a data that represents a real-life data science task.

The problem can also be found in the Kaggle challenge [2].

There are four data files associated with this project:
1.	Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).
2.	Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).
3.	Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).
4.	Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).

For more information about the columns depicted in the files, it is possible refer to two Excel spreadsheets the are provided too:
1.	DIAS information levels - attributes2017.xlsx: is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category
2.	DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx: is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order

## Figures
Some figures are generated with the code and are saved in the directory. They are figure like elbow plot, missing per row, missing per columns, etc.

## Results
All coding with results is commented on step by step jupyter notebook (Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb). The detailed analysis can be read project.pdf
